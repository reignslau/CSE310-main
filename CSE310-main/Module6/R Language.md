R is a programming language and environment specifically designed for statistical computing and data analysis. It was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and it is now maintained and developed by the R Development Core Team and a global community of contributors.
R is widely used in academia, research, and industries like finance, healthcare, marketing, and more, where data analysis and statistical modeling are essential. It has gained popularity due to its flexibility, extensibility, and the strong community support that continuously develops and improves the language.
